# Alpication

Do your job application easily with Alpication: Just set the needed parameters and fill the (two) provided
environments with content - there you go! You may want to take a look at the example.tex


### Signets

When a signet is used, a size of 600x240px and (transparent) PNG is strongly recommended.


### Internationalization

Currently there are two available languages, English (default) and German, which is activated with the package
option ``german''. Feel free to contribute more languages to the project!


### Dependencies

To use this class, you will need the packages currvita and wrapfig, which can be found here:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/currvita
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/wrapfig
All other dependencies should be solved by your texlive installation.


### Formatting

To change the formatting, you may want to modify the alpication.cls class file. Basically, its environments
do all the magic. Page formatting is done mainly in the AtBeginDocument block.
